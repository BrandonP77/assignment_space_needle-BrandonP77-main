# Assignment_Space_Needle

This is the starter file for the 'Space Needle' homework assignment for BIT 142.

You'll notice that there's already files named FreeFormAsciiArt.java and AssignedAsciiArt.java - please put your work in there.

There's also a text file named "RENAME THIS FILE WITH YOUR NAME.txt" - please rename that to have your name, and put your name inside the file in a clear, easy to find way that unambiguously makes it clear that this is your homework that you're doing.

For example, if Mike Panitz was doing this homework assign he would rename "RENAME THIS FILE WITH YOUR NAME.txt" to be "Panitz, Mike.txt" and make sure to put the name "Mike Panitz" (or "Panitz, Mike" - either is fine) inside the file.
